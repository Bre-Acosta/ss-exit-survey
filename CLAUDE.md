This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Starting Strength Gyms member retention project focused on creating and implementing an exit survey system for cancelled members. The primary goal is to gather insights that will inform tactics for improving member retention metrics.

## Business Context

- **Company**: Starting Strength Gyms (startingstrengthgyms.com)
- **Primary Goal**: Improve member retention through data-driven insights
- **Survey Purpose**: Non-pressuring feedback collection from ex-members to identify improvement opportunities
- **Key Personnel**: John Haun (jhaun@startingstrengthgyms.com), Scott Acosta (sacosta@startingstrengthgyms.com)

## Current Assets

- `Fwd_ Exit Survey.pdf`: Email thread containing exit survey requirements and initial survey excerpt
- `Memphis-3-line-black-wordmark.png`: Starting Strength Gyms branding asset
- Survey covers areas: overall experience, value perception, expectations, coaching attention, physical results, program structure, facility quality, community atmosphere

## Survey Design Principles

- **Non-pressuring**: Survey should not attempt to save the departing member
- **Disclosure-promoting**: Questions designed to encourage honest feedback
- **Insight-focused**: Data collection aimed at actionable retention tactics
- **Professional tone**: Warm, respectful, and curious approach

## Potential Development Areas

If this project requires technical implementation:

### Survey Platform Development
- Web-based survey form implementation
- Response data collection and storage
- Analytics dashboard for retention insights
- Email integration for automated survey delivery

### Data Analysis Features
- Member retention metrics tracking
- Response categorization and trend analysis
- Reporting tools for management insights
- Integration with existing gym management systems

### Technology Considerations
- Member privacy and data protection compliance
- Integration with existing Starting Strength systems
- Mobile-responsive survey design
- Automated follow-up workflows

## Key Questions for Future Development

1. What survey platform or custom solution is preferred?
2. How should survey responses be stored and analyzed?
3. What existing gym management systems need integration?
4. What member data privacy requirements must be met?
5. How will survey delivery be automated and timed?

## Domain-Specific Context

- **Starting Strength**: Evidence-based strength training methodology
- **Member retention**: Focus on identifying why members leave vs. trying to save them
- **Metrics-driven**: Emphasis on data collection for tactical improvements
- **Service areas**: Coaching, program structure, facility quality, community, results delivery
